      <h2>Letra</h2>
      <p>Let's go <br> <br>
        Steve walks warily down the street <br>
        With his brim pulled way down low <br>
        Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet <br>
        Machine guns ready to go <br>
        Are you ready hey are you ready for this? <br>
        Are you hanging on the edge of your seat? <br>
        Out of the doorway the bullets rip <br>
        To the sound of the beat yeah <br><br>
        Another one bites the dust <br>
        Another one bites the dust <br>
        And another one gone and another one gone <br>
        Another one bites the dust <br>
        Hey I'm gonna get you too <br>
        Another one bites the dust <br><br>
        How do you think I'm going to get along <br>
        Without you when you're gone <br>
        You took me for everything that I had <br>
        And kicked me out on my own <br>
        Are you happy are you satisfied? <br>
        How long can you stand the heat <br>
        Out of the doorway the bullets rip <br>
        To the sound of the beat look out <br><br>
        Another one bites the dust <br>
        Another…</p>
