      <h2>Letra</h2>
      <p>You know, I was <br>
        I was wondering, you know <br>
        If you could keep on <br>
        Because the force <br>
        It's got a lot of power <br>
        And it make me feel like ah <br>
        It make me feel like... oooh! <br><br>
        Lovely is the feeling now <br>
        Fever, temperatures rising now <br>
        Power is the force, the vow <br>
        That makes it happen, it asks no questions why <br>
        So get closer <br>
        To my body now <br>
        Just love me <br>
        'Til you don't know how <br><br>
        Keep on with the force don't stop <br>
        Don't stop 'til you get enough <br>
        Keep on with the force don't stop <br>
        Don't stop 'til you get enough <br>
        Keep on with the force don't stop <br>
        Don't stop 'til you get enough <br>
        Keep on with the force don't stop <br>
        Don't stop 'til you get enough <br><br>
        Touch me and I feel on fire <br>
        Ain't nothing like a love desire <br>
        I'm melting (I'm melting) <br> 
        Like hot candle wax <br>
        Sensation (oh sensation) <br>
        Lovely where we're at <br>
        So…</p>
